        <h1>Nature</h1>
        <p> As a Human Being we always think about what should we do and should not do. What are our responsibility towards nature? What are responsibility? Who told you your responsibility and your rights? You yourself decides it. And being a human you always put your self first than think about others. So basically answer of the question our responsibility toward nature is don't be a human being. Nature puts us as an animal so be an animal. Dont be a human. Being human we always just talk about something, and never apply on that. And At end just sit tight, do whatever you do to survive, nature is keeping all calculations and at last it will settle our all debits/credits toward nature.a</p>
